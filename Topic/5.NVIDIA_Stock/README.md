# Topic 5 – Single-Stock Case Study: NVIDIA (NVDA)

**Level:** Medium  
**Goal:** Univariate forecasting and volatility exploration for a single stock.

## Dataset

- **Source:** NVIDIA (NVDA) Historical Stock Price Data – Kaggle
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elnazalikarami/nvidia-corporation-stock-historical-quotes

## Download Instructions

1. Open the dataset link above.
2. Click "Download".
3. Extract to `data/`.
4. Use the main CSV (e.g. `HistoricalData_....csv`).

## Data Loading

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/NVDA_HistoricalData.csv")  # adjust filename
df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])
df = df.set_index("Date").sort_index()
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load NVIDIA stock price data
- Inspect OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) and Volume data
- Focus on Close price for forecasting
- Calculate returns (simple and log returns)
- Examine trading volume patterns

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plot stock price over time
- Plot returns distribution
- Analyze volatility clustering
- Calculate and visualize rolling statistics (mean, std)
- Perform time series decomposition
- Analyze ACF/PACF of prices and returns

### 3. Volatility Analysis
- Calculate realized volatility (rolling standard deviation of returns)
- Identify volatility regimes (high vs low volatility periods)
- Analyze volatility clustering (GARCH-like patterns)
- Plot volatility over time

### 4. Stationarity Analysis
- Test stock prices for stationarity (typically non-stationary)
- Test returns for stationarity (typically stationary)
- Apply differencing to prices if needed
- Consider log transformation

### 5. Model Building
- **Price Forecasting:**
  - ARIMA models on prices or log prices
  - Consider trend models
- **Returns Modeling (optional):**
  - ARMA models on returns
  - GARCH models for volatility (if time permits)
- **Model Selection:**
  - Use AIC/BIC for comparison
  - Validate on hold-out set

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Split data temporally (e.g., last 20% as test)
- Generate price forecasts
- Calculate accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Analyze forecast errors
- Visualize forecasts with confidence intervals

### 7. Volatility Forecasting (Advanced)
- If implementing GARCH:
  - Model volatility dynamics
  - Forecast future volatility
  - Compare with realized volatility

## Expected Deliverables

1. **EDA Report:**
   - Stock price and returns plots
   - Volatility analysis
   - Decomposition plots
   - ACF/PACF analysis

2. **Model Results:**
   - Selected model with parameters
   - Price forecast accuracy
   - Volatility analysis (if applicable)
   - Forecast plots

3. **Code:**
   - Complete Python notebook
   - Functions for price/returns analysis
   - Volatility calculation utilities

## Tips

- Stock prices are typically non-stationary; use returns or differencing
- NVIDIA is a tech stock with high volatility - expect large price swings
- Consider external events (earnings, product launches) that affect prices
- Volatility clustering is common in stock returns
- Use log returns for better statistical properties
- Consider multiple forecast horizons (1-day, 1-week, 1-month)
- Document any major events (splits, earnings) that affect the series
